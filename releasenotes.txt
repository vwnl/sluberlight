V10

+ Fixed a bug where the application was visible while pushing alt-tab while minimized.

V9

Renamed versioning number, to be cool and hip, like Firefox and Chrome.

+ Fixed a small bug where closing the program unexpectedly would leave the tray icon;

+ Added JSON parsing, so the details are a bit more human readable
